Ingredients for Gajar Halwa
To make this classic dessert, you’ll need the following ingredients:

1 kg red carrots (grated)

1 liter full-cream milk

1 cup sugar (adjust according to taste)

4-5 tablespoons ghee

8-10 cashews (chopped)

8-10 almonds (slivered)

8-10 pistachios (optional)

4-5 cardamom pods (crushed or powdered)

A pinch of saffron strands (soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk, optional)

Step-by-Step Recipe for Gajar Halwa in winters
Step 1: Choose and Prepare the Carrots 
The first step in making gajar halwa is to choose the right carrots. Opt for fresh, tender red carrots as they’re naturally sweet and cook faster.

Wash the carrots thoroughly to remove any dirt or impurities.

Peel the carrots and grate them finely using a hand grater or food processor. Finely grated carrots cook evenly and absorb flavors better.

Step 2: Cook the Carrots in Milk 
Take a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai and add the grated carrots.

Pour the milk over the carrots and bring it to a boil.

Lower the heat and let the mixture simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent the milk from sticking to the pan.

Cook until the milk reduces and is absorbed by the carrots. This step may take around 20-30 minutes.

Step 3: Add Sugar and Ghee 
Once the milk is absorbed, add sugar to the mixture. The sugar will release some moisture, making the halwa slightly watery.

Continue to cook on medium flame until the moisture evaporates and the mixture thickens.

Add ghee and mix well. Cook for another 10 minutes while stirring continuously. The ghee will enhance the flavor and give the halwa a glossy texture.

Step 4: Add Flavor and Garnish 
Sprinkle cardamom powder and mix well for that classic aroma.

Add chopped nuts and raisins. Stir to combine.

Cook for an additional 5 minutes and turn off the heat.

Serve warm, garnished with more nuts on top.
